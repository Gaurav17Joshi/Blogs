## The implementation
In the first two weeks I focussed on understanding the implementation of the project. In the source repository Celerite library was used for GP implimentation and Bilby was used for Bayesian Inferencing, while in my project my mentor and I decided to completely use a Jax based backend hense, Tinygp for GP, and Jaxns for Nested Sampling.

I made a proof of Concept implimentation for the QPO kernel and gaussian mean model for a lightcurve, which is explained in breif here:-

### Kernel:
For making the Kernel, I used Tingp.quasisep.celerite kernels which are a fast implementation (based on the celerite kernel) of the Qpo kernel.

$k_{qpo+rn}(\tau) = k_{qpo}(\tau) + k_{rn}(\tau)$

$$k_{qpo+rn}(\tau) = k_{qpo}(\tau) + k_{rn}(\tau)$$

$$k_{qpo+rn}(\tau) = a_{qpo} \exp(-c_{qpo} \tau) \cos(2\pi f \tau) + a_{rn} \exp(-c_{rn} \tau)$$

```math
k_{qpo+rn}(\tau) = k_{qpo}(\tau) + k_{rn}(\tau)
```

The `quasisep.exp` kernel for the red noise part and the `quasisep.celerite` kernel for the qpo part can be implemented as:
```python
hqpokernel = kernels.quasisep.Exp(
    scale = 1/hqpoparams["crn"], sigma = (hqpoparams["arn"])**0.5) + kernels.quasisep.Celerite(
        a = hqpoparams["aqpo"], b = 0.0, c = hqpoparams["cqpo"], d = 2*jnp.pi*hqpoparams["freq"])
```

### Mean:
We are working on Extremely powerful events in the universe which emit radiation in the Xray spectra. Many of these have some sort of flaring behaviour, and also in general, we wanted to add mean functions to our GPs as this feature will be extended to other astronomical time series.

For this proof of concept implimentation, I used a simple gaussian mean to test out sampling using Jaxns
Using the tinygp library to make the gaussian process and sample out some lightcurves from it.

```python
def gaussian(t, mean_params):
    return mean_params["A"] * jnp.exp(-((t - mean_params["t0"])**2)/(2*(mean_params["sig"]**2)))

mean_params = {
    "A" : 3,    "t0" : 0.5,    "sig" : 0.2,}

mean = functools.partial(gaussian, mean_params = mean_params)
# Making the Gp
gp = tinygp.GaussianProcess( kernel, t, mean=mean, diag = diag)
gp_sample   =  gp.sample( jax.random.PRNGKey(11), shape=(1,))
```

### Priors and likelihoods
As we want to fit our Red noise and Qpo + Red noise model on the lightcurve, we need to make suitable prior funcitons for them. We use Jaxns.Prior to make a generator prior function, and make a corresponding likelihood function, which makes the gp and calculates the log likehood of producing the given lightcurve.

We set the bounds for the prior functions based on the suggestions given in the source paper, and plot the fitted maximum posterior gp on the lightcurve. 

```python
# Prior Model Function
def RNprior_model():
    T = Times[-1] - Times[0]    # Total time
    f = 1/(Times[1] - Times[0]) # Sampling frequency
    min = jnp.min(lightcurve); max = jnp.max(lightcurve)
    span = max - min

    # Red noise kernel prior
    arn = yield Prior(tfpd.Uniform(0.1*span, 2*span), name='arn') 
    crn = yield Prior(tfpd.Uniform(jnp.log(1/T), jnp.log(f)), name='crn')

    # Gaussian mean priors
    A = yield Prior(tfpd.Uniform(0.1*span, 2*span), name='A') 
    t0 = yield ForcedIdentifiability(n = 1, low = Times[0]-0.1*T, high = Times[-1]+0.1*T, name='t0')
    sig = yield Prior(tfpd.Uniform(0.5*1/f, 2*T), name='sig')
    return arn, crn, A, t0, sig

# Log Likelihood Function
@jit
def RNlog_likelihood2(arn, crn, A, t0, sig):
    rnlikelihood_params = {"arn": arn, "crn": crn,
                        "aqpo": 0.0, "cqpo": 0.0, "freq": 0.0, }
                
    mean_params = { "A": A, "t0": t0, "sig": sig, }
                
    gp = build_gp(rnlikelihood_params, mean_params, Times, kernel_type = "RN")
    return gp.log_probability(lightcurve)

# Nested Sampling using Jaxns
RNmodel = Model(prior_model= RNprior_model, log_likelihood=RNlog_likelihood2)
RNexact_ns = ExactNestedSampler(RNmodel, num_live_points= 500, max_samples= 1e4)
RNtermination_reason, RNstate = RNexact_ns(random.PRNGKey(42), term_cond=TerminationCondition(live_evidence_frac=1e-4))
RNresults = RNexact_ns.to_results(RNstate, RNtermination_reason)

```

But the main use is not just to fit a GP, but rather to acess whether it contains a QPO or not. For that, we compare the evidence (Bayes Factor) of the lightcurve for a QPO_RN Gp and RN GP, and as expected, for a high QPO sample, we get a high value of (-212 - (-262)) = 50.

The image in the top is of the QPO model sampling.

The corner plot shows the result of the sampling, and the frequency of 20Hz is captured well in it.
